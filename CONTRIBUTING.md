# Contributing to Dialectica AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Dialectica AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** ensuring you follow the code style
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Create a Pull Request** with a clear description

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Fill in the required template
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs when appropriate
- Follow the TypeScript and React/Node.js best practices
- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests
- Document new code based on the existing documentation style
- End all files with a newline

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`

## Issue Reporting

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Provide a clear description of the problem you're solving
3. Describe the solution you'd like
4. Consider the scope and complexity
5. Be patient - features take time to implement
